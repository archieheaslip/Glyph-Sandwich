# Glyph Sandwich
__A script for Glyphs which places a chosen glyph on either side of all selected glyphs. Useful for spacing and kerning.__

__How to install this script__
- Go to the Script menu at the top of the Glyphs window.
- In the Script menu, click on Open Scripts Folder. This will open the folder where Glyphs stores its scripts.
- Place the GlyphSandwich.py file into the opened Scripts folder.
- Now, while in Glyphs, click on the Script menu again. Then hold down Option and click Reload Scripts.
- Glyph Sandwich will now appear in the Script menu.

__How to use this script__
- First, select the glyphs you would like to use and then click on Glyph Sandwich in the Script menu.
- Enter the glyph you would like to place on either side of the selected glyphs and click Make Sandwich.
- Now you have your Glyph Sandwich :)

__I used AI to create this script so it's not perfect but it works... kind of.__
- If you switch masters after running this script in the edit view, only the selected glyph will change. To overcome this, select all glyphs and then change master.
